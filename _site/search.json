      "content"     : "Why?Do you like this website? It was free! In this guide, I’ll drag you a high-level process for building THIS VERY WEBSITE (wow!) with GitHub Pages. If you don’t have prior coding knowledge, this article might not be enough.GitHub has great articles on how to complete this process, but I want to document the gotchas I experienced while setting up this bomb-ass site. P.S. GitHub can do other cool things for authors too. Here’s one author’s experience with git.Nice-To-Haves Prior coding knowledge or the time to learn Command line knowledge1. GithubMatch your author name to your GitHub account username. I (Vera Briene) might pick verabriene as my GitHub account name.If you’re new to git, consider using a tool like Git Kraken to organize your project.Make the ProjectPick where your code will live. Each website will live in it’s own project (works like a computer folder). To create a new project, follow this guide.Complete “Creating Your Website”, skip the last section “Change Title and Description.” We’ll deal with the title later.SO IMPORTANT!! This sets your default website URL, so use your author name! For me, that might be - verabriene.github.io authorverabriene.github.io vbriene.github.ioGitHub will give you these domain names for free, as long as they end in github.io.Your live website will live at www.yourname.github.io. It won’t work quite yet, though.This is where I might have lied to you. To get the optional cute URL www.yourname.com, have to pay a yearly domain fee (usually $12) for the name. I buy mine from Google Domains. Setting up custom domain names can be found hereInstall ToolsInstall the following tools to create your website - Jekyll builds your website! Here are the instructions. Visual Studio Code. You may use Scrivener, Word, or Google Docs to write your novels. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a similar tool for developers. If it looks scary, remember it’s just a fancy Microsoft Word. Download and install that Here is the download..Bring the Project to Your ComputerLet’s bring the project to your computer.The workflow will be - Write content on your computer and test it Send it to GitHub Launch the website If this is brand new, find a coder friend and have them work alongside you.Git CloneUse your terminal to git clone your repository. This brings the code to your computer to work on (like downloading an email attachment to open on your computer). Here is a great video on using git.Changes in VS CodeOpen the entire folder in VS Code. Consider downloading a Jekyll project plugin! You will be making changes in the posts/ folder (we’ll learn how later).Jekyll ServeBefore making changes, test your installation with Jekyll. I chose to add the starter site first. Inside of your project folder, follow the instructions here.Some tips - Reload the webpage (localhost:4000) after you make changes If your changes aren’t showing, restart the jekyll serve commandGit Commit + PushUse git commands to git add, git commit and git push. Your website won’t launch until you do this. Go to the URL you chose above, such as www.yourprojectname.github.io, and double-check that your website is present.Optional: Pick Branch StrategySome authors want to make a “work in progress” branch where they can save undeployed changes. This allows authors to commit and push changes without them going live on the website.I live by the YOLO principle and make changes directly on main because I am fastidious about checking my changes on my computer first.Creating ContentNow you want to add things to your website. By default, you can add markdown pages in the _posts folder, git commit them, and have your website. Figure out how to add a post now. Some tips - Copy and paste an existing post page. There should be one called “_posts/2023-08-26-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown”. The post above tells you exactly what needs to go in a post. Play around with markdown files. You can add links, images, and formatting.The banner pictures live in assets/img/posts in a folder with the date. Make sure your resolution is high enough (over 1500 pixels).After this, the themeing is purely aesthetic.Picking ThemesI used this one. There are excellent instructions in his README to install.I wanted to make HTML and CSS changes, so I went the route of downloading the project manually and copy-pasting into my project folder. To do this - Erase everything that already exists in the folder except your .git files. Paste. Make sure to exclude their .git files. Tip! Some folders (like _site/) are built every time you restart the server. Make sure to make changes in the top-level assets/, _layout, and _include folders if you’re getting wild with code changes.Deployment and BeyondMaking changes to _config.yml is the last step to build your Jekyll project. For the theme above, I had to - Change the site settings at the top of the file Adjust the author settings Adjust the social media settings. These get tagged in every author element (an example is the author page and post pages toward the bottom)If you need help, we can set up a one-on-one consult session, or you can check the newsletter for upcoming group classes.Enjoy!"
