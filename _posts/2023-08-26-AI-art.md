## Killing Careers?

Let's look at Sally, a 30 year old artist who creates commissioned character art and book covers for fantasy novelists. As we discuss the ethics around AI art, we'll keep Sally in mind.

Discussions between authors and Sally have pointed to one opinion - using AI kills careers and snatches creator content without consent. Let's look at the workflow of AI to talk about why -
1. Tools like Dall-E scrape the internet and take a peek at Sally's art.
2. Dall-E says "Sure, I can use that style to generate my own versions."
3. Authors publish AI art for sales. This might include printables for books and social media posts.

Sally hates this for several reasons. First, AI puts her out of a job. With AI on the loose, her commissioned art can be replaced by Dall-E's almost-free generated art. For Sally, AI art is a death sentence. She's built a niche and following around an industry that's being replaced with automation. 

> For artists, AI is a death sentence

Another detractor -- AI is trained by looking at Sally's work. Sally went to art school and sweated for years to develop a unique art style. In seconds, Dall-E learned and replicated her content. Remember, everything AI does is derivative. AI models are trained by looking at people's work and making iterations based on prompts. **Dall-E isn't advancing art in the same way Sally can. Dall-E doesn't need a paycheck to eat.**  

## Authors Are Broke 

Authors are frustrated too. For indie novelists, AI can create character art and covers that were previously unattainable due to financial constraints. Not all authors can afford to pay Sally. AI tools like Dall-E and Artbreeder open the door to integrated art when you're broke as a joke.

The author and art communities has unanimously agreed that AI art is harmful, but we've still seen hundreds of popular art and author accounts post AI generated work. Use at your own risk and be aware that authors with significant traction have been cancelled for AI art. 

## Using Public Domain

"But Vera, I'm really broke."

There are options. 

First and foremost, pay artists when you *can*. As novelists, we're excited to be paid! Treat artists the same way you want novelists to be treated.

Get inspired by work in the public domain. Sites like [www.pexels.com](www.pexels.com) are a great source for royalty-free art. Take a look at their [license page](https://www.pexels.com/license/) for information on how you can use their content.

[Open Access](https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html) images are a wonderful tool. Read through their [license policy](https://www.nga.gov/notices/open-access-policy.html) as well.

A hard-mode option is to train as an artist. Many are afraid that their work isn't good enough, but readers appreciate seeing their favorite characters come to life, even if the art is rough.

Finally, pay for stock images. I got really inspired by [Ibai Acevedoo's](https://www.stocksy.com/IbaiAcevedoo/showcase?page=1) work, and liked that I could pay $15 for photography with a pretty generous standard royalty free license.
