The temple I serve feeds on rituals of lust and power, but when decay creeps into my world, I'm told to give more - higher stakes, escalating rites, and new partnerships with dangerous men. My offerings stabilize the damage, but now, the temple's corrupt leader is obsessed with me. How do I escape his twisted control? The four men I'm matched with protect me, but secrets haunt these halls. How do I survive as temple royalty? Who is abusing its power?
