## Cover and Titles

I stumbled across [this creative penn article](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2018/10/08/doubling-down-on-what-you-love-and-opportunities-when-publishing-wide-my-ninc-2018-round-up/) when researching how and what to title my book. I'm scared! I have two shots to capture readership.
1. Have a bomb.com title
2. Pick a great cover

I chose my cover art, but as you can see, *mmmm has sex with ff in a basement* is a lacking title.

## Titling for the Id

The article above states that titling for the id -- the things that scream "pleasure" -- communicates to the reader that the book will contain something juicy that they'll love.

Here's the list of pleasures contained in my novel -
- Reverse harems (*sigh*, I'll never get over them) and found family 
- Every mm and ff spicy combination with my 4 male and 2 female protagonists
- mlm and wlw
- Fucking your best friend 
- Dangerous men with tattoos
- Twisted power dynamics
- A twinkle of exhibitionism and BDSM
- Scandalous ballgowns

I briefly considered throwing my latin-inspired setting name (Domus Aeterna) into the title, but was quickly scolded. It's not readable and it doesn't convey that are there 6 people fucking each other and finding love in a dangerous temple.

## Make a Word List

Making a vocab chart is baller advice. If a title doesn't come organically, I'll throw a dart and see what sticks. 

|Noun|Verb|Adjective||Noun|Verb|Adjective|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Tension|Burn|Dark|*|Summer||
|Fog|Grip|Obligated|*|||
|Mist|Tattoo|Scorched|*|||
|Temple|Pant||*|Revolt||
|Tattoo|Command||*|Danger||
|Ink|Obey||*|Love||
|Rain|Reach||*|Object||

## Titles in my Genre

My omg-so-amazing mentor [Jeannie Lin](http://www.jeannielin.com/) told me to go list some book titles in my genre. See what's selling!

*Queen Takes Knights* by Joely Sue Burkhart. I think this is the winner of "reverse harem titles with bomb covers." I snatched these books up in an instant and knew exactly what I was getting into. The title definitely embodies the concept of powerful women (queen), sex (takes), and that reverse harem (knights, plural). Also, let's take a moment to gush over that cover art. I love the chess reference (intrigue).

*Sex Wizards* by Alethea Faust. Love this! The series title doesn't fuck around. It gets straight to the point.

*Helfyre* by Mariel Pomeroy. Hel- (There will be dangerous demons within), -fyre (Burning tension? Romance? I love it all)

## Don't Pick These...

While doing this exercise, I noticed a trend in my Goodreads TBR list. Without clear titles, I had no idea which novels were reverse harem and which weren't. The clear titles above told me exactly what was in the book. Vague or fantasy-esque titles didn't get me there if I wasn't already familiar with the world (looking at you, *A Castle/Court/Dawn of _ and _*).
